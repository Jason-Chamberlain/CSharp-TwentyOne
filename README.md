# C# Twenty One Application
### Project Description

This repository contains a text-based casino application completed during the C# and .NET course at [The Tech Academy](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/). The primary aim was to simulate the renowned card game "21" (Blackjack) through a console-based interface. This project provided a hands-on learning experience, allowing the use of fundamental programming ideas using the C# language and demonstrating the application's functionality through interactive gameplay.

## Project Overview
### User Interaction and Gameplay

1. **Personalization:** Users were greeted with the name of the virtual casino, "Grand Hotel and Casino," and prompted to input their names.

1. **Administrator Access:** As a special case, access was granted to administrative users who entered "admin" as their player name. This allowed viewing of logged exceptions.

1. **Bankroll Management:** Users were instructed to specify the desired amount of starting money, personalizing their gaming experience.

1. **Gameplay Start:** Players could initiate participation in a game of 21 (Blackjack) by responding positively to the invitation.

1. **Game Execution:** While within the game, players were provided with virtual currency (bankroll) for betting. They were guided through the core gameplay mechanics of the card game.

1. **Exception Handling:** The application effectively managed exceptional scenarios, including fraud attempts and unexpected errors.

## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated
### Foundational C# Concepts

- **Syntax Proficiency:** Proficiency in using correct C# syntax to define classes, methods, variables, and control structures was demonstrated, showcasing mastery of basic language elements.
